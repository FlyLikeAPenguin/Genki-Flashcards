# Genki Flashcards

This project is created as a companion to the Genki textbooks for learning Hiragana, Katakana, and Kanji.
The flashcards are grouped by the corresponding lesson in the textbook and can easily be turned on/off as you progress.

## Project Goals

- To further develop my knowledge of react - specifically states and props.
- To create a fully featured flashcards app that could be easily re-used with different data in other projects.
- To have the user's lesson selection persist between sessions.
- To be mobile friendly.
- To be able to be hosted on github pages.
- ~~To use Google's firebase to serve the data.~~ Decided against due to the need to authenticate or have potential cost.
